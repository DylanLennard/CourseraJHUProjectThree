                            Datasets Reported
=============================================================================
The analysis returns two datasets, mergedDF and meanDF. The mergedDF is a dataset consisting of both training and testing datasets, appended on matching variables, with only the fields representing mean values and standard devations of values reported. The meanDF is a much smaller dataset consists of the mean values of each field in mergedDF aggregated by both subject and action. 

==============================================================================
                                Variables  
==============================================================================
All field in both of the final datasets end with Mean or StdDev to indicate which measurement of a given variable was analyzed. Many fields may also further end with _X, _Y, _Z to indicate the coordinate upon which the measurement is taken.  

The fields included are the following:  

subject: the given subject the row corresponds too  
action: the given action performed in a given row 

All other fields contains abbreviation for various components of what is measured.

Domain
time: time based domain
freq: frequency based domain  

Source of Signal
Body: body acceleration signals
Gravity: gravity acceleration signals 

Device of Measurement Source
Acc: accelerometer 
Gyro: gyroscope  

example: timeBodyAccMean_Y represents time based domain measurement of body acceleration signals from the accelerometer on the Y dimension.  

Some variables also contained further abbreviations to represent measurement of the following fields:  





The data for each variable are reported as normalized vectors, and thus the largest possible magnitude of force for any given field is 1 or -1 depending on orientation of direction.
